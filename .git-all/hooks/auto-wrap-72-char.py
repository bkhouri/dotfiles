    Given a commit message, add line breaks at appropriate places such that no line
    in the message is more than 72 characters wide.

    :param originalMessage:
    :param linesep: line separator that is inserted into the message
    :param message: a file object representing the commit message
    :param maxWidth: the maximum width for the message

    Exception: URLs or other long strings that are more than 72 characters wide
    (since these cannot be broken up)

    The algorithm below tracks the position of one previous whitespace character
    and maintains a running count of characters since the last new line. If the count
    exceeds 72, the next whitespace is replaced by a (os-specific) line separator

    Existing line breaks are left as-is, as are any lines that are less than 72 characters long.
    Note: There exists a "textwrap" library python that will wrap commit messages
    to a specified width. However, it truncates in the middle of an url (or a long string)
    if its length is more than the max width. I welcome any suggestions and/or contributions
    around performance improvements.
